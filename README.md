This Repository provides examples to onboard whole organisations to StackGuardian. 

First, the respective permissions and resources will be created in the Cloud Providers - Service Accounts(GCP), Roles (AWS), SPN(Azure). 
Second, the permissions are tied to StackGuardian Cloud Connectors, that will allow StackGuardian to perform actions within the Cloud Project/Account/Subscription.

For these purpose, follow the README.md within the respective cloud provider.
